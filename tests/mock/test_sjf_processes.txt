# Test processes for SJF Scheduler Integration
# Format: PID ArrivalTime Bursts Priority RequiredPages
# SJF selects the process with the shortest CPU burst

# Test Case 1: Processes arrive at the same time but with different burst lengths
P1 0 CPU(8) 1 2
P2 0 CPU(2) 1 2
P3 0 CPU(4) 1 2

# Test Case 2: Processes arrive at different times
P4 10 CPU(10) 1 2
P5 12 CPU(3) 1 2
P6 14 CPU(5) 1 2
P7 16 CPU(2) 1 2

# Test Case 3: Processes with I/O
P8 25 CPU(6),E/S(2),CPU(3) 1 2
P9 26 CPU(4) 1 2

# Test Case 4: Extreme case - very long process vs several short ones
P10 35 CPU(15) 1 3
P11 36 CPU(1) 1 2
P12 37 CPU(2) 1 2
